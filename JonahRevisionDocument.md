# Game Design Document

## Goal
*Define the primary goal or vision of the game here.*

## Purpose for Game (or Evaluation Criteria)
*Clarify purpose, as this can incorporate some of the evaluation aspects.*

---

## Interactive Actions

### Risky Actions
- **Crime and Jail Mechanics**
  - Explain the mechanics around crime and punishment.
  
### [Subcategory for Each Interactive Action]
  - Provide clear descriptions for each type of interactive action the player can take. Considering that your game is supposed to be an expanded version of the original Bit Life Simulator Game, this should be major selling point. Discerning the various specific actions you can take that will set this game apart from the original and make it more immersive and interactive.

## Expanded Interactive Elements
*Separate these into new blocks or organize into relevant categories where they fit best.*

## Design Suggestions

1. **Menu UI** - Design a user interface for selecting actions.
2. **Death Screen** - Create a unique design for a death screen.
3. **Opening UI** - Add a UI with buttons for:
   - Play
   - Play with custom settings
4. **Timeline Design** - Provide a more specific description of the timeline structure.
5. **Design Clarity** - Review and clarify specificity in the overall design.

## Additional Features
- Refine interactive elements for clarity and organization.
- Integrate a concise and logical flow for player actions.
- Tutorial that goes through the core features of the game so new players can get acquainted
- Although not required, if you have access to or can create a basic sprite for the character icons or action buttons, that might clarify some aesthetics and immerse the readers of your design framework more into the style of your game.

## Notes on User Flow
- 1. clarify what 'overall impact means' - I assume that the ending and recap is when the player dies, make sure to clarify this in this line
- 2. User Flow should highlight player actions/options on every screen (or no action if it's a transition screen). I'd suggest being specific here in options players can take for each screen, or 'gameplay' if it's just the main page.

## Notes
- Remove the last AI generated line. (unnecessary conclusion)
